 Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview  

*  In project 3 "around the US" we use a tool called grid. grid is a helpful tool to creater responsive layout of images that are exported from the web.
* for example, we use the "grid-template-columns" this defines the column of the css container. Go into depth, the  minmax value, is to create repsonsive and flexible grid layouts. this value helps define the minimum grid size it can be flexible but in certain jumps. ![image](https://github.com/Burger007/se_project_aroundtheus/assets/72559320/dff33ac9-b6e3-4974-a4c9-c5029cefb941) The auto value prevents the iamges to get squeeed all together andd keeps it wide as possible as it can.

* another useful tool we can use in order to make the website responsive without any erroes is the grid-template-area: ![image](https://github.com/Burger007/se_project_aroundtheus/assets/72559320/162af9ba-990d-4ad5-9895-a96cc0a94c5e) The  grid-template-area, is a rectangular area consisting of one or more grid cells. This is apllied to the grid container tells ho much space should it contain. NOTE! it is crucial that it look like a rectangular shape and not "L" shaped, if it would be shaped as an "L" the propery wont work and no changes would be made.
