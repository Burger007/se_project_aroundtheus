 Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview  

*  In project 3 "around the US" we use a tool called grid. grid is a helpful tool to creater responsive layout of images that are exported from the web.
* for example, we use the "grid-template-columns" this defines the column of the css container. Go into depth, the  minmax value, is to create repsonsive and flexible grid layouts. this value helps define the minimum grid size it can be flexible but in certain jumps. ![image](https://github.com/Burger007/se_project_aroundtheus/assets/72559320/dff33ac9-b6e3-4974-a4c9-c5029cefb941) The auto value prevents the iamges to get squzed all together andd keeps it wide as possible as it can.

* another useful tool we can use in order to make the website responsive without any erroes is the grid-template-area: ![image](https://github.com/Burger007/se_project_aroundtheus/assets/72559320/162af9ba-990d-4ad5-9895-a96cc0a94c5e) The  grid-template-area, is a rectangular area consisting of one or more grid cells. This is apllied to the grid container tells ho much space should it contain. NOTE! it is crucial that it look like a rectangular chaped and not L shaped, if it would be shaped as an "L" the propery wont work and no changes would be made.

**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
